                    Although we are most partial to the Bailey Bridge Boat hulls, this site is dedicated to all fishermen and hunters that are enthusiasts of any old aluminum fishing boats and their restoration and fabrication. If you love old aluminum military boats, work vessels, and unique or unusual old boats, this is the site for you.
      
                    We look at these old vessels like an artist looks at a blank canvass.
      
                    Each person has fabricated their boat to specifically meet their individual tastes and needs. We enjoy sharing this information with each other for entertainment value, as well as a source for new innovative ideas.
      
                    If you are like we are; you have discovered that your tastes and needs for the ideal fishing or hunting boat will not be mass produced... they must be created.
      
                    This site is for you, so take a look around and feel free to contact us with questions or additions to the site that you would like. Please feel free to send us information or photos of any odd, unique or extremely old aluminum vessel pictures, information, and fabrication processes you have about them.
