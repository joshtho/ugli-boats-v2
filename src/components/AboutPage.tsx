        My love for the ponton bridge half-section boat was developed when I let a neighbor, who was moving, store his ponton bridge boat at my house. He was very proud of it and wouldn't sell it for less than $3000.
        <br />
        <br />
        At that time I thought he had it way over priced for a big "Jon-Boat". During the three years that he left it here, I kept offering more money, but I could never bring myself to spend that much on a hull. I had named it FISHGUTS.

        When my ex-neighbor finally came and got his boat - I almost immediately regretted not grabbing it when I had the chance.
        <br />
        <br />

        I spent months researching online to find a used "store-bought" equivalent that was at least 18.5' long and 6' wide at the floor. It also had to have sides high enough to take out in big water, and low enough and flat bottomed enough to easily fish out of.

        Let me tell you... I could not find anything at a reasonable price that had all the great features of these old ponton bridge boats. I eventually changed gears and began a relentless search for my own ponton bridge boat. My dreams of finding a surplus auction where I could get one for $300 faded very quickly.

        <br />

        I tracked down many false leads, scouring all the government auction sites and calling military bases nationwide. It wasn't too long before I realized that the days of buying a stack of these at a military surplus auction are long gone. I didn't have any luck finding one, but my luck was starting to change when I struck up a friendship with a guy that is a good boat mechanic, and quite a craigslist boat section expert.
        <br />
        <br />

        For a hobby, we started dabbling in buying, fixing-up and selling old boats. I told him about Ol' Fishguts - (The One That Got Away), and he started to keep an eye out for another one. After about a year of searching, he called late one evening and said he found my dream, less than 50 miles away. The ad said nothing about "army boat" "ponton bridge boat" "big aluminum boat" or anything remotely Google-able. The ad simply read; "OLD FISHING BOAT". Luckily there was a picture and he recognized the boat.

        When I saw it I decided to call her "UgliBoat". It had an old 100 Johnson on it, center console, and a rotted floor. The transom had been cut out and heavy steel reinforcements were attached. The guy wanted $2500, and even though I usually try to get a bargain, I didn't even haggle over the price.
